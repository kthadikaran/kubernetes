# Kubernetes:
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible open-source platform managing containerized workloads and services, also it facilitates both declarative configuration and automation the of containerized applications.

## Kubernetes Objects:
Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Specifically, they can describe:  
What containerized applications are running (and on which nodes)
The resources available to those applications
The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance
