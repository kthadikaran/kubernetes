# Kubernetes:
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible open-source platform managing containerized workloads and services, also it facilitates both declarative configuration and automation the of containerized applications.

## Kubernetes Objects:
Kubernetes objects are persistent entities in the Kubernetes system. Kubernetes uses these entities to represent the state of your cluster. Specifically, they can describe:  
1.What containerized applications are running (and on which nodes)  
2.The resources available to those applications  
3.The policies around how those applications behave, such as restart policies, upgrades, and fault-tolerance  

### Pod  
A pod is a group of one or more containers. A container is an enclosed, self-contained execution process, much like a process in an operating system. Kubernetes uses pods to run your code and images in the cluster.  

Kubernetes works with Pods, rather than containers, so that containers in the same pod can be guaranteed to run on the same machine. Containers in the same pod share their networking infrastructure, storage resources, and lifecycle.  
Exaple YAML file.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:latest
```
### ReplicaSet
A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.  

A ReplicaSet then fulfills its purpose by creating and deleting Pods as needed to reach the desired number. When a ReplicaSet needs to create new Pods, it uses its Pod template.  

A ReplicaSet is linked to its Pods via the Pods' metadata.ownerReferences field, which specifies what resource the current object is owned by. All Pods acquired by a ReplicaSet have their owning ReplicaSet's identifying information within their ownerReferences field.  

#### When to use a ReplicaSet
A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time. However, a Deployment is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods along with a lot of other useful features. Kubernetes, recommend using Deployments instead of directly using ReplicaSets, unless you require custom update orchestration or don't require updates at all.  

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: frontend
  labels:
    app: guestbook
    tier: frontend
spec:
  # modify replicas according to your case
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: php-redis
        image: gcr.io/google_samples/gb-frontend:v3
```

### Deployment:  
A deployment is an object in Kubernetes that lets you manage a set of identical pods.  
Without a deployment, youâ€™d need to create, update, and delete a bunch of pods manually.  
With a deployment, you declare a single object in a YAML file. This object is responsible for creating the pods, making sure they stay up to date, and ensuring there are enough of them running.  
You can also easily autoscale your applications using a Kubernetes deployment.  
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
In this example:

A Deployment named ```nginx-deployment``` is created, indicated by the ```.metadata.name field.```    

The Deployment creates three replicated Pods, indicated by the ```.spec.replicas field.```  

The ```.spec.selector``` field defines how the Deployment finds which Pods to manage. In this case, you select a label that is defined in the Pod template (app: nginx). However, more sophisticated selection rules are possible, as long as the Pod template itself satisfies the rule.  

```Note: The .spec.selector.matchLabels field is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". All of the requirements, from both matchLabels and matchExpressions, must be satisfied in order to match.```  

The ```template``` field contains the following sub-fields:  

The Pods are labeled ```app: nginx``` using the ```.metadata.labels``` field.  
The Pod template's specification, or ```.template.spec``` field, indicates that the Pods run one container, ```nginx,``` which runs the ```nginx``` Docker Hub image at version 1.14.2.  
Create one container and name it nginx using the ```.spec.template.spec.containers[0].name``` field.  


### Sevices:  
A Service enables network access to a set of Pods in Kubernetes.  
Services select Pods based on their labels, when a network request is made to the service, it selects all Pods in the cluster matching the service's selector, chooses one of them, and forwards the network request to it.  

The type property in the Service's spec determines how the service is exposed to the network. It changes where a Service is able to be accessed from.The possible types are are below:  

**ClusterIP:** The default value exposes a service which is only accessible from within the Kubernetes cluster you can not make requests to your Pods from outside the cluster.  
**NodePort:** This makes the service accessible on a static port on each Node in the cluster. This means that the service can handle requests that originate from outside the cluster.  
**LoadBalancer:** The service becomes accessible externally through a cloud provider's load balancer functionality.  
Example Service Manifest YAML file.  
```apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: selector-demo-service
  namespace: livonlin
  labels:
    name: livonlin_service
    app: nginx
    project: livonlin
    environment: test
spec:
  externalTrafficPolicy: Local
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: nginx
  type: NodePort
  ```

### Object spec and status
Almost every Kubernetes object includes two nested object fields that govern the object's configuration:   
1.object spec  
2.object status.  

For objects that have a spec, you have to set this when you create the object, providing a description of the characteristics you want the resource to have: its desired state.  

The status describes the current state of the object, supplied and updated by the Kubernetes system and its components. The Kubernetes control plane continually and actively manages every object's actual state to match the desired state you supplied.  

### Describing a Kubernetes object
When you create an object in Kubernetes, you must provide the object spec that describes its desired state, as well as some basic information about the object (such as a name).   
When you use the Kubernetes API to create the object (either directly or via kubectl).  

Here's an example .yaml file that shows the required fields and object spec for a Kubernetes Deployment:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41946619/147801496-2ae31bad-ab17-46ca-ae91-49ee66cca5c3.png)

#### Required Fields  
In the .yaml file for the Kubernetes object you want to create, you'll need to set values for the following fields:  

**apiVersion** - Which version of the Kubernetes API you're using to create this object  
**kind** - What kind of object you want to create  
**metadata** - Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a name string, UID, and optional namespace.  
**spec** - What state you desire for the object  

### Kubernetes Object Management  
The kubectl command-line tool supports several different ways to create and manage Kubernetes objects.  

#### Management technique
1. Imperative commands- Live Objects  
2. Imperative object configuration-Individual  fles  
3. Declarative object configuration- Directories of files  

### Namespaces  
In Kubernetes, namespaces provides a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster.  

#### Kubernetes starts with four initial namespaces:  

**default** The default namespace for objects with no other namespace.  
**kube-system** The namespace for objects created by the Kubernetes system  
**kube-public** This namespace is created automatically and is readable by all users (including those not authenticated). This namespace is mostly reserved for cluster usage, in case that some resources should be visible and readable publicly throughout the whole cluster. The public aspect of this namespace is only a convention, not a requirement.  
**kube-node-lease** This namespace holds Lease objects associated with each node. Node leases allow the kubelet to send heartbeats so that the control plane can detect node failure.  

### Labels and Selectors  
Labels are key/value pairs that are attached to objects, such as pods. Labels are intended to be used to specify identifying attributes of objects that are meaningful and relevant to users, but do not directly imply semantics to the core system. Labels can be used to organize and to select subsets of objects.  
Labels can be attached to objects at creation time and subsequently added and modified at any time.  
Each object can have a set of key/value labels defined. Each Key must be unique for a given object.
